                            <strong>Background</strong> <br/> To increase the accuracy of microbiome data analysis, solving the technical limitations of the existing sequencing machines is required. Quality trimming is suggested to reduce the effect of
                            the progressive decrease in sequencing quality with the increased length of the sequenced library. In this study, we examined the effect of the trimming thresholds (0–20 for QIIME1 and 0–30 for QIIME2) on the number of reads
                            that remained after the quality control and chimera removal (the good reads). We also examined the distance of the analysis results to the gold standard using simulated samples.

                            <strong>Results</strong>
                            <br/> Quality trimming increased the number of good reads and abundance measurement accuracy in Illumina paired-end reads of the V3-V4 hypervariable region.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Conclusions</strong>
                            <br/> Our results suggest that the pre-analysis trimming step should be included before the application of QIIME1 or QIIME2.

                            When first dealing with data related to microbiome it became clear to me that the process is very difficult, and there are no clear rules for the analysis process. I was then required to analyze a large number of samples belonging to a large project,
                            the problem was: First: Establish the way in which the data will be analyzed, and that method must be free so that a large number of people can use it. Second: Automating this process so that it can be applied to a large number
                            of samples to reduce the effort expended, as well as trying to work with more than one processor at the same time. In order to achieve these goals, we chose
